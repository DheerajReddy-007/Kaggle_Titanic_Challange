# Kaggle_Titanic_Challange

## The Challenge

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).


### Prediction_Description::
Prediction has been mode using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest Classifier ML models for the provided data. Submission file consists of two columns PassengerId and the predicted binary value implying whether the respective passenger has survived or not.

My Submission had a prediction accuracy of 76.794 %.
